    "#### 1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- There are 12 orders in total  in which the order date spans from february to march and orders are made by 9 customers.\n",
    "- The results from the database shows that the average order **(Mean)** value that the online store made from february to march is $1,175.00 and the middle value **(Median)** are $600.00 where the most frequent value **(Mode)** is $500.00 while the minimum **(Min)** sales price  is $200 on 2/4/2024 *(February 02, 2024)* and the highest **(Max)** sales price is $5,000. The midrange of the sales are $2,600.00 and the Range are $4,800.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Category Comparison\n",
    "- Yes There is differences on the average total per category as the average of all is $1,175.00 and for the **Food** category the average is $1,075.00 where its a 91.59% of the average of all category, lower than the average of all category and the average of the **Electronics** are $2,650.00 which is 225.53% of the average of all category, higher than the average of all category while for the **Healthcare** are $625.00 which is 53.19% of the average of all category, lower and lastly the **Clothing** is $1,000.00 which is 85.11% of the average of all category.\n"
